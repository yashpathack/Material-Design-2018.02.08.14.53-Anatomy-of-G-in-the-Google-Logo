# Material Design 2018.02.08.14.53 Anatomy of G in the Google Logo
This is an experimentation to understand the symmetry and analyse the geometry of the G in the Google logo. It appears as the thumbnail on your tab each time you google. In fact its everywhere. So, this is an effort to grasp the depth of Material design of the logo.

Let's start then. 
## Draw a circle around the outer post of the letter G as in the logo

As you can see, the circle do not enclose the 'G' fully. This is non-symmetric.

Look at the gaps and edges missed during the circular enclosure. 

## Now join the yellow arc of "G" to the blue rectangular end of it

The closures join up and form a rectangle.
## Join up to the extreme of the yellow curve using straight lines

Here you can see the symmetry of the two rectangles.
